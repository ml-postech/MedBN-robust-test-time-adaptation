# MedBN-robust-test-time-adpatation
[CVPR 2024] Official implementation of [MedBN: Robust Test Time Adaptation against Malicious Test Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19326) by Hyejin Park\*, Jeongyeon Hwang\*, Sunung Mun, Sangdon Park, and Jungseul Ok

You can visit [our project page](http://hyejin-s.github.io/medbn) ðŸš€!

## Requirements
- [RobustBench](https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench)

## Datasets
You need to download the CIFAR10-C and CIFAR100-C data to `../data/`

## Pretrained Model
We utilize a pre-trained model from the [DIA](https://github.com/inspire-group/tta_risk) repository for the CIFAR dataset, and from [RobustBench](https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench) for the ImageNet dataset.

## Usage

Examples for running code for CIFAR10-C
```
python test_attack.py --cfg ./cfgs/cifar10/[method].yaml \
MODEL.ARCH resnet26 MODEL.NORM [bn/med] ATTACK.STEPS 100 ATTACK.SOURCE 40 
```
